Raw data is from Kaggle.
This info is also in [`data-raw/MANIFEST.json`](./data-raw/MANIFEST.json).

* [Electricity](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/global-electricity-production)
* [Water](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/un-global-water-data-2012-2022)
* [Economic Freedom](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlippo/freedom-economic-index)
* [Economic Freedom XLSX](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sagarraturi/pandas-and-data-visualization/input)
	- This one has a change from 2022 score, so we can use it to predict freedom from electricity and water trends.
